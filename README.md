# Open Lilybot

A Discord bot that renders Lilypond code using Node.js. This is not meant as a complete replacement for a Lilypond installation, but instead a tool to be used when a snippet of music is to be shared.

## Requirements

* A Unix-like system. This has currently been tested only on Arch Linux and will most likely not work on Windows without modifying the code. That said, you can edit the code as you wish on your machine to make it work.
* [Discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js). Used to interact with Discord.
* [Discord.js Collections](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/collection) Used to interact with Discord.
These two should be able to be installed by simply typing `npm install`.
* [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/index.html). Used to compile Lilypond code. Install this like any other software (e.g. on Arch Linux, `pacman -S lilypond`).

## Installation

There is no link to invite "the bot", instead the code that makes the bot work is presented here â€” think of it like how you can't drive a motor, but how you can put the motor in a car to drive the car, you can't use the code that's here, but you can create your bot with this code. This is due to it executing commands in the terminal which isn't supported by certain server hosting services, and because it requires Lilypond, which isn't provided in the NPM. Instead, you should do the following:

* Create a new bot yourself by going to Discord's Developer Portal.
* If not already done, install Lilypond, and run `npm install` in the same directory.
* Optionally, change the prefix as defined in `config.json`.
* Run `node bot` in your favourite terminal.

## Configuration

Currently, the following can be configured by editing the `config.json` file. Editing the JSON file should be straight forward, even for people with little experience with JSON.

* The prefix used. By default, this is `$lilypond`.

## Usage

Run the `help` command to find out how to work the bot correctly.
